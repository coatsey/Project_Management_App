# Project_Management_App


I created a Project managment app using android studio. In this app I use a lot of diffent features include Firebase to store all the data. You can create accounts that allow you to make boards. Inside those boards you can make lists and cards that you can assgin to yourself and others. you can give them a color to be able to see what is most important plus you can add a due date to them. You can add and delete cards as you go. you will get an alert message when you get added to a board or the due date is approaching. You can update your profile/board with a picture.
